# Tamara Express Checkout – SmartPay AI for KSA

A mini concept for Tamara (Saudi Arabia’s leading BNPL platform) to help users pick the **right installment plan automatically** during high‑spend periods like Ramadan and back‑to‑school.

## The Problem

Tamara users in Saudi juggle multiple installment options and bills at once.  
During peak spending months, it’s hard to know **which plan keeps them safest** (cash flow, due dates, limits), which can increase confusion and missed payments.

## The Idea – SmartPay AI

**SmartPay AI** is an in‑app assistant that:

- Reads a user’s **spending + repayment patterns** over time  
- Scores each available plan by **affordability and risk**  
- Recommends an **“optimal” plan** (or top 2) for this purchase  
- Explains *why* in simple, Arabic‑friendly language (e.g., “This keeps your monthly total below X SAR.”)

Target context: high‑ticket purchases, stacked BNPL plans, and seasonal spikes (Ramadan, Eid, back‑to‑school).

## What’s in the Demo

The live page walks through:

- **User journey:** From checkout → SmartPay suggestion → confirmation  
- **UI concepts:** Plan cards with “Smart choice” labels, risk indicators, and education nudges  
- **Strategy:** How this could improve repayment behavior, trust, and lifetime value in KSA

## Why It Matters for Tamara

- **Clearer decisions:** Less cognitive load when choosing plans  
- **Healthier portfolios:** Better repayment outcomes and lower default risk  
- **Stronger brand:** Positions Tamara as a **financial ally**, not just a payment button

## This project showcases:

- Understanding of **GCC fintech & BNPL behavior**
- Translating financial stress points into **simple UX**  
- Connecting UX changes to **business outcomes** (retention, NPS, risk)

If you work on product, growth, or credit at a BNPL/fintech in MENA and want a deeper dive, happy to share the thinking behind the flows.
